This repo is here to help you learn about """hacking""". It contains methods on how to obtain flags on [root-me.org](https://www.root-me.org/). These are my methods, and they are not always the best ones.
So, if you successfully get a flag, I invite you to then check all other solutions that has been written by other users, there is a lot to learn !

If you are only getting started with hacking, most people will advise you to start with the "Web-Server" section. I think it is pretty good, but if the words HTML/CSS/Javascript are not familiar to you, you are going to have a tough time. But we have to get started at some point right ?

Also, hacking is tough. You will sometimes find yourself stuck for a few days, even a few week. Do not come for solutions too fast. You will learn only by practicing, and copy/pasting is not practice. So if you are really motivated search by yourself, read documentation (I remember an exercise about a Pyjail where I had to read the doc of 50 functions to find a way to escape), and try things.

Of course, these are my solutions, and sometimes, like any human being, I am stuck. So there is no solution for certain exercises (a lot currently). So if you have more experience, feel free to fork my repo, or create your own. The goal is to share knowledge, not to earn some of those precious github's stars.

The list in each directory has been automatically created by parser.py, feel free to use it for your own usage. To do that, just copy the content of any https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/CATEGORY/ page in a file (by default it is reading 'web-server' file), create a 'readme.md' file, and launch python3 parser.py.

It should automatically append the 'readme.md' file with info like "NameOfChallenge : Done/Not Done" for this category.
