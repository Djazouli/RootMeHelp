The idea is that a line is a sum of combination of format PxN where P is a pixel (white if 1, black is 0), and N the number of successive pixel of this type.

So we just have to parse the string and output a image ("filename.png") with the script Pixel_Madness.py, and we can read:
"SOLUTION", which is the flag.
