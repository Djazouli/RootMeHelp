We know that Sha2 is supposed to return strings of length 64. Here, the length is 65.
Also, there cannot be any 'k' in a sha256.

We take it off, and obtain :

```
96719db60d8e3f498c98d94155e1296aac105c4923290c89eeeb3ba26d3eef92
```

We reverse this, and obtain : 4dM1n

Compute the sha1 of this word, and submit your password.
