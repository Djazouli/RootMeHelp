The documentation teach us that if two strings starts with 0e, then their loose comparison will be true. Then, if we take 0e as a seed, and finding to have a hash starting by 0e, the loose comparison will be true. Well, a quick search informs us that 240610708 has a md5 hash of 0e462097431906509019562988736854.

So with seed **0e**, and hash **240610708**, we get the flag!
