The goal is to do more than 999999 points. Obviously, we are not going to click until we make a better score. Open the source code and, see that the value is generated by a onsubmit() method.

You can just modify the source code, so that you are sure to make a good score, or you can create your own request:

```
curl -X POST -d "score=10000000000&generate=submit" http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch56/
```

You receive a response containing:

```
<p>Wow, 10000000000! How did you do that? :o</p><p>Flag to validate the challenge: <strong>FLAG</strong></p>
```

Congratz !
