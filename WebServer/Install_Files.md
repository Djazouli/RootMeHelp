  By opening the source code, we discover the folder http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch6/phpbb/
After reading some documentation (helped by the title of the challenge) about phpBB, we discover that installation files are by default stored in ~/phpbb/install, and a file in particular is install.php.

Just go to http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch6/phpbb/install/install.php, discover a nice summary (in french), and your flag !

The summary is explaining that these files should have removed by the webmaster. Thanks to these files, you could have reset the site, change all passwords, and have a total control.

The flag is : karambar.
